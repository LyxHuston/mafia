    "wiki.entry.article.how_to_play.text":"This guide is for typical game modes. To learn how to play other game modes, ask the host.\n\nThe game has two major teams, Town and Mafia. The goal is to be the last team remaining alive. The town wants to find out who the mafia is and vote them out. The mafia wants to deceive the town to try to stay hidden so they don't get voted out.\n\nEvery role has abilities. Abilities are how players collect information, kill players, and prevent kills, among other things.\n\nIn order to find out who the mafia is, townies need to share information they have in order to deduce who is lying about their role. This is done with the use of alibis, which are records of the abilities you have used and information you have gathered. Alibis are posted in the chat and graveyard when the player dies. Here is an example of a typical alibi that a Detective would have.\n\n> Detective\nNight 1: Deodat Lawson - Innocent\nNight 2: Samuel Parris - Suspicious\n\nWhen the Detective posts this alibi in chat, they provide evidence to other players that on the second night, they found Samuel Parris as Suspicious, implying that Samuel Parris is a mafia member. If the town believes the Detective, they will likely vote them out.\n\nFor a mafia member to pretend to be a town role, they need to write a fake alibi to pretend to be a town role. _IF A PLAYER DOES NOT HAVE AN ALIBI, THEY ARE LIKELY A MAFIA MEMBER_ who doesn't know how to write a fake alibi, and they should be directed to this page.\n\nIn order to write a fake alibi, it is important to know how the town role that is being faked works. Above is an example of a Detective alibi; To fake claim more roles, it is important to look at the encyclopedia article for that role and learn about the role to write a fake alibi for it.",

    "wiki.entry.article.phases_and_timeline.text":"The game is always in a phase. Phases run in this order:\n\n### Night\nThis is when most roles use their abilities. Chat is closed at night so players can not communicate with each other. However, some roles can communicate with others at night, for example, the medium can talk to the dead, and mafia can talk with each other.\n\n### Morning\nPlayers see who died last night, their alibi, and any death notes that were placed on the body. \n\n### Discussion\nPlayers discuss information they have to try to find out who the evil players are, or if they‚Äôre evil themselves, pretend to. Evil players will often try to throw out red herrings or pin the blame on someone else.\n\n### Voting\nPlayers vote to put a player on trial, but this doesn‚Äôt always mean that player is going to be killed. The players need a majority of the votes in order to put someone onto trial. If the voting phase ends before a majority is reached, it goes directly to night after. There can be a maximum of three trials during each day.\n\n### Testimony\nThis phase comes after voting only if a player was voted onto trial. The player on trial gives their testimony while everyone else stays quiet. Usually the player on trial will claim a role and post their alibi here.\n\nIf you have been voted for a trial, don‚Äôt give up. Even if you‚Äôre evil, you can lie your way out of getting hanged.### Judgment\nThis phase comes after testimony. Everyone votes either innocent, or guilty. If there are more guilty votes than innocent votes, the player on trial is killed. Players can also choose to abstain. The judgment period is usually how the town gets evil players killed.\n\n### Evening\nA brief period before night. If someone was voted guilty today, this is usually where they get to say their final words.\n\nWhen there are three or less players alive, each phase is half as long as it usually is.",
